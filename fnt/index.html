        <p>Throughout most of the learning area, we tell you to just open your examples directly in a browser — this can be done by double clicking the HTML file,
             dragging and dropping it into the browser window, or choosing File > Open... and navigating to the HTML file. There are many ways to achieve this.
            If the web address path starts with file:// followed by the path to the file on your local hard drive, a local file is being used. 
            In contrast, if you view one of our examples hosted on GitHub (or an example on some other remote server), 
            the web address will start with http:// or https://, to show that the file has been received via HTTP.<a href="#">[Load More]</a></p>
